## Environment & Package Management
- Always use `uv` for environment and package management in python
- Before installing any new package, search for and review its documentation
- `uv add` to add packages
- `uv sync` to update packages
- `uv venv project-name` for virtual environment instancing
- `pyproject.toml` has the names for the installed packages
- Include brief justification comments for each package addition
