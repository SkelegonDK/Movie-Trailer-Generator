Conflict: {st.session_state.selected_points['Conflict']}

Guidelines:
- Write ONLY the voice-over script, nothing else.
- Use a dramatic, intense tone typical of movie trailers.
- Include powerful, attention-grabbing phrases.
- Allude to the plot twist without revealing it entirely.
- Keep it between 50-75 words.
- Do not include any audio cues, sound effects, or scene descriptions.
- Focus solely on what the narrator would say in the trailer.
- add impact to specific words or phrases using uppercase.

Formatting instructions:
- Use a new line to separate each sentence.
- Add a new line after every period (.), exclamation mark (!), question mark (?), and comma (,).
- Ensure there's a blank line between each formatted line for clarity.
- Do not include notes or comments.
- Do not include the title of the movie.
