Once Ollama is installed and running, you need to download a language model.
This application is tested with `llama3.2:3b`, which is a good balance of performance
and capability for many systems.

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
```
This command will download the model files to your computer. You can download other models
from the [Ollama Library](https://ollama.com/library) as well. The application will automatically
detect any models you have installed.

That's it for the setup! Now you can use your local models in the generator:

1.  Go back to the main **Movie Trailer Generator** page using the sidebar navigation.
2.  In the **Model Settings** section of the sidebar, toggle on **"Ollama mode"**.
3.  Select your desired installed model from the dropdown list that appears.

The application will now use your selected local Ollama model to generate the movie title and script.
