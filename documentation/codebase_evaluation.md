# Codebase Evaluation Report

This report outlines potential areas for improvement in the Stupid Movie Trailer Generator codebase based on an initial analysis.

## 1. Dependency Management

*   **Observation:** Multiple dependency management systems are present (`requirements.txt`, `Pipfile`, `Pipfile.lock`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`).
*   **Issue:** Causes confusion, potential conflicts, and complicates setup/deployment. Unclear source of truth.
*   **Recommendation:** Standardize on a single system (e.g., `uv` with `pyproject.toml`). Remove unused configuration files. Update `README.md` with clear setup instructions for the chosen system.
*   **Rationale:** Simplifies setup, ensures environment consistency, reduces maintenance.

## 2. Configuration Management

*   **Observation:** `config.py` exists but is underutilized. Hardcoded values found in `app.py` (OpenRouter model list, UI colors) and potentially `scripts/functions.py` (Ollama URL/model). Inconsistent default model (`config.py` vs. `app.py`).
*   **Issue:** Reduces flexibility, increases maintenance effort. Configuration changes require code modification. Inconsistencies lead to confusion.
*   **Recommendation:** Move all configurable parameters (API endpoints, model lists/defaults, UI constants, file paths) into `config.py` or a dedicated config file. Ensure consistency. Pass the `Config` object explicitly rather than relying on a global instance.
*   **Rationale:** Centralized configuration enhances maintainability, flexibility, and clarity. Explicit passing improves testability.

## 3. Separation of Concerns & Modularity

*   **Observation:**
    *   `app.py` (412 lines) mixes Streamlit UI, state management, and high-level logic flow.
    *   `scripts/functions.py` (410 lines) contains most core logic but is monolithic.
    *   `scripts/openrouter_client.py` exists, showing partial abstraction.
    *   Root `functions.py` (18 lines) seems redundant.
*   **Issue:** Large files mixing responsibilities are hard to navigate, test, and maintain. Core logic is tightly coupled.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Keep `app.py` focused on UI, state, and orchestrating backend calls.
    *   Refactor `scripts/functions.py` into smaller, focused modules within `scripts/` (e.g., `llm_interface.py`, `ollama_client.py`, `audio_utils.py`, `file_utils.py`).
    *   Create a unified interface (`llm_interface.py`) for `app.py` to interact with different LLMs (Ollama/OpenRouter).
    *   Delete the root `functions.py`.
    *   Move helper functions from `app.py`'s `main()` into appropriate `scripts/` modules.
*   **Rationale:** Improves modularity, readability, testability, and maintainability. Reduces coupling.

## 4. Error Handling

*   **Observation:** Basic error handling exists (`try-except`, checks for keys/models/generation success).
*   **Issue:** Error handling could be more specific (e.g., network vs. API vs. model errors). User feedback lacks detail. No logging.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement specific `try-except` blocks around API calls in `scripts/` modules. Use `st.error` with more informative messages in `app.py`. Add logging (Python's `logging` module).
*   **Rationale:** Improves user experience and significantly aids debugging.

## 5. Code Duplication

*   **Observation:** Logic structure in `app.py` for handling local vs. remote models shows structural repetition (generate name -> check -> generate script -> check).
*   **Issue:** Leads to duplicated code patterns.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement the unified LLM interface (from Point 3). This will allow `app.py` to call single "generate name" and "generate script" functions, simplifying the logic and removing duplication.
*   **Rationale:** Reduces redundancy, improves readability, simplifies `app.py`.

## 6. Project Structure

*   **Observation:** Presence of `src/`, `stupid_movie_generator/`, and `scripts/` directories alongside root Python files (`app.py`, `config.py`).
*   **Issue:** Ambiguous project layout. Standard Python projects usually prefer a single `src/` or project-named directory.
*   **Recommendation:** Consolidate all source code (from `scripts/`, `stupid_movie_generator/`, root `.py` files) under a single main directory (`src/` or `stupid_movie_generator/`). `app.py` can remain at the root as the Streamlit entry point. Update imports. Clean up unused directories.
*   **Rationale:** Adheres to standard Python project structure, improving clarity and convention.

## 7. Streamlit Specific Improvements

*   **Caching (`@st.cache_data` / `@st.cache_resource`):** Functions loading static data (`get_trailer_points`, `get_ollama_models`) should use caching decorators to improve performance by avoiding redundant executions.
*   **Function Encapsulation:** Break down UI rendering and logic within `app.py::main()` into smaller, dedicated Python functions (e.g., render_sidebar(), render_cards(), render_main_content()) for better organization and readability.
*   **Layout and UI Consistency:** Review the column layout for necessity (especially the empty column). Use `st.container` for grouping. Consider Streamlit Theming or CSS via `st.markdown` for styling instead of hardcoded colors for better maintainability.
*   **State Management Optimization:** Group related variables within `st.session_state` using nested dictionaries for better organization (e.g., `st.session_state.ui`, `st.session_state.generation`). Initialize state systematically.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Ensure buttons/elements are appropriately disabled (`st.button(disabled=True)`) when prerequisites are not met (e.g., disable audio generation before script exists) to guide the user clearly.

## Proposed Refactoring - First Steps

1.  **Consolidate Dependency Management.**
2.  **Centralize Configuration.**
3.  **Refactor `scripts/functions.py` into smaller modules.**
